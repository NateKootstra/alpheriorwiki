The Alpherior Games Wiki
------------------------
This dual wiki is dedicated to documenting both Genome Guardian and Cell Command.

If you would like to contribute, make a fork and a pull request when the changes are done. `info.py` is where all of the data is stored. As I don't check the repository often, you may want to send me an email (natekootstra@gmail.com) to let me know.
If there is a mistake, please do not open an issue here as I rarely check it. Shoot me an email instead (natekootstra@gmail.com) and I'll be sure to resolve it.
If you would like to host your own version as allowed by the MIT license, it is recommended that you do not run `main.py` to host the server in production. Use a production WSGI server.
